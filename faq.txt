O11 FAQ

Q: Why O11 ?
A: Well ... why not ? I like the idea of building a website with javascript objects only.

Q: What are core objects ?
A: A core object can't have other core objects for making his properties. 
   Only a O11_prop object is allowed for making a property.

Q: Is O11 ready for production ?
A: No. It still very buggy. It's only for testing.
